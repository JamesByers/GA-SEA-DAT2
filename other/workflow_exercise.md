## Practice: Data Science Work Flow (25 mins)
Use three of the steps from the Data Science Workflow (identify, acquire, present) to get to know your classmates!

> We will form 3 groups, each at a different whiteboard around the room.

#### IDENTIFY: Understand the problem (5 min)
Each group will develop at least one 1 research question that they would like to know about the class and make a hypothesis.
> Note: Don't share these questions with the rest of the class just yet!

Example:
- What are you most excited about learning? - Our hypothesis is that most people want to finally know what Pandas is!


#### ACQUIRE: Obtain the data (5 min)
Each group will rotate through the other groups whiteboards and record the raw data on white boards to "collect the data".

> Create an easy visual way for the other students to write their answers, or some other way to facilitate quick capture of the data.

#### PRESENT: Communicate the results of your analysis (15 min)

- State question you were trying to answer with the data (Problem to be solved) and hypothesis
- Summarize findings in a narrative
- Provide a basic visualization for broader comprehension on white board
- Have one student present for the group
